Cute Bears VS Wild Dragons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i05Y_1hk80, en, "00:00:00.160 This place is a dream. But I can't help
00:00:03.040 wondering if it's abandoned. Why is
00:00:04.880 there so much stuff here?
00:00:06.560 Iceber's wondering that, too.
00:00:08.240 Uh, you see, the house used to be uh the
00:00:11.040 set for a TV show. Wow. Which TV show?
00:00:14.480 Fantastic Francis uh Outlaw piano
00:00:16.720 teacher. If Francis taught piano, why is
00:00:20.080 there no piano in the house? Oh, because
00:00:22.800 he taught piano in a secret piano
00:00:25.039 fortress. That makes sense.
00:00:26.800 Makes sense to Ice Bear.
00:00:32.880 I can't believe they canled the flight
00:00:34.880 because the plane was infested with
00:00:36.640 pigeons. What the pigeons need a plane
00:00:38.960 for? Anyway, they can fly.
00:00:41.200 So, can we
00:00:44.480 um nope.
00:00:47.680 The honeymooners are home.
00:00:50.719 So, water honor. What do we do?
00:00:52.960 Chill, dog. I'll hide your broth. You
00:00:55.360 create a diversion.
00:00:56.559 Great.
00:00:57.870 [Applause]
00:01:00.060 [Music]
00:01:02.800 Hey you two, wouldn't it be fun if we
00:01:04.879 all hid under this table immediately?
00:01:06.960 Totally.
00:01:07.760 Icebro's just thinking the exact same
00:01:09.520 thing.
00:01:11.920 This is nice. Diversion. Diversion.
00:01:16.479 I know. I'll run around the yard naked.
00:01:18.720 Uh, honey.
00:01:22.150 [Music]
00:01:23.520 Honey, we have passed and they got into
00:01:26.080 all our rich paper food.
00:01:31.439 The whole house is probably infested.
00:01:33.520 Call the exterminator.
00:01:35.200 Yeah. What do I do? What do I do? What
00:01:36.799 do I do? What do we do? What do I do?
00:01:39.040 They're like big fuzzy ants. Please send
00:01:42.079 someone over to eliminate this problem
00:01:44.079 right now.
00:01:45.680 Wow, that was fast.
00:01:47.680 Oh, thank goodness. Lucio. Oh, are you
00:01:51.759 an exterminator?
00:01:54.320 No, I'm the exterminator.
00:01:59.119 You've done a good job of trapping them,
00:02:01.040 miss. These pests are extremely
00:02:04.159 dangerous. Now, all you need to do is
00:02:06.320 give them to me, and rest assured, I'll
00:02:08.399 take care of them.
00:02:12.480 Anya, I want them exterminated right
00:02:14.959 this instant.
00:02:18.400 Uh,
00:02:20.160 exterminate.
00:02:21.840 Exterminate.
00:02:23.440 Exterminate.
00:02:25.120 Exterminate. Sure. But let me take them
00:02:27.599 out to the yard. I don't want to make a
00:02:29.599 mess inside.
00:02:31.340 [Music]
00:02:34.720 They will come right back.
00:02:38.260 [Music]
00:02:40.480 Oopsy doodles. I left all my
00:02:42.319 extermination gear back at the office.
00:02:46.720 Don't be silly, honey. Fetch the sword.
00:02:51.680 Surely this ornate Chinese sword will
00:02:53.920 do.
00:02:55.030 [Music]
00:02:59.120 I don't want to bore you with the
00:03:00.560 details, but yeah, I need more than this
00:03:03.280 tiny sword.
00:03:06.410 [Music]
00:03:11.440 See honey, I told you my parents wedding
00:03:13.840 present would come in handy.
00:03:19.599 Thanks.
00:03:20.800 Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
00:03:24.480 Got to exterminate these guys now.
00:03:28.480 [Music]
00:03:32.400 Huh?
00:03:34.400 Please
00:03:36.480 don't exterminate my brothers.
00:03:38.799 Exterminate me instead.
00:03:42.080 These are your brothers.
00:03:44.400 Yes. Well, the bears, not the otter.
00:03:48.879 So, you are not even an exterminator.
00:03:52.720 No, I'm just a bear on a mission to find
00:03:56.400 a home for me and my bros.
00:03:59.360 I've been lying to everyone, even my own
00:04:01.840 brothers.
00:04:04.560 So, please let some go and take me out
00:04:07.920 instead.
00:04:13.030 [Music]
00:04:15.040 So, you mean you have no place to live?
00:04:18.478 No place to call home?
00:04:20.478 Uh, no.
00:04:30.000 You sorry I lied to you, bros. I can
00:04:32.479 learn to forgive you.
00:04:34.240 But you told me to lie.
00:04:36.320 Sorry."
