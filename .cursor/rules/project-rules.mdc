### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- All code lines when rendered into UI must be responsive to devices, mobile first, tablet, web
- Dark mode/ light mode should always be applied in every UI code
- Write unit tests for all possible cases and make sure they all pass. If they don't pass, fix all the wrong code and rerun the test cases until the errors are gone.
